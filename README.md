# 🔭 Jeff Barry

**`Narrative Engineer (Creator/Developer/Mentor)`**

🌱 crafting tools for interactive storytelling

💬 I'm in my last 18 months as Library Technology Developer, and Associate Professor of Data Science & Digital Culture and Information at Washington and Lee University. In summer 2025, I'm moving abroad to focus on AI & 3D graphics for interactive experiences. 

📚 🖥️ ✍️ At the core of my life's work—whether in my roles as a librarian, software developer, writer, or reader—lies a deep commitment to comprehending the ways we craft and consume stories, both fictional and factual, within digital media. Viewing the evolving landscape of creativity, learning, and leisure through the prism of my young child's future profoundly shapes my vision for contributing to the evolution of narrative in the twenty-first century.
